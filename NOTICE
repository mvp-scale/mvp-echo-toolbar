MVP-Echo Toolbar
Copyright 2026 MVP-Scale.com

MVP-Scale.com is building the world's first SaaS foundry -- a community
and pipeline for launching foundational MVPs at 5-10x speed. This tool
is one piece of that pipeline.

MVP-Echo started as a simple idea: what if you could talk instead of type
while coding? Not dictation in the traditional sense, but real-time voice
as a development accelerator. Larger prompts. Faster iteration. Hands on
the keyboard for code, voice for everything else.

It went through multiple iterations -- from cloud-dependent to local CPU,
from prototype to production, from a personal tool to something we could
share. Every version was test-driven. Every decision was about speed
without sacrificing quality.

The result: voice-to-text that runs in under 300ms with 99% accuracy,
lives in your system tray, and never sends your audio to the cloud.
It makes us 3-10x faster. It might do the same for you.

We're not building through vibe coding or AI hype. We're taking real
ideas, pushing them fast, iterating relentlessly, and shipping things
that work. This is our pipeline in practice.

If you build on this, fork it, extend it, or just find it useful --
we'd love to hear from you. We're building more tools like this, and
your use case might shape what comes next.
